 We present a theoretical treatment for the ejection of a secondary electron
from a clean metallic surface induced by the impact of a fast primary electron.
Assuming a direct scattering between the incident, primary electron and the
electron in a metal, we calculate the electron-pair energy distributions at the
surfaces of Al and Be. Different models for the screening of the
electron-electron interaction are examined and the footprints of the surface
and the bulk plasmon modes are determined and analyzed. The formulated
theoretical approach is compared with the available experimental data on the
electron-pair emission from Al.
