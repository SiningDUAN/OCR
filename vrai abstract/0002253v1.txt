 We have studied experimentally and theoretically the influence of
electron-electron collisions on the propagation of electron beams in a
two-dimensional electron gas for excess injection energies ranging from zero up
to the Fermi energy. We find that the detector signal consists of
quasiballistic electrons, which either have not undergone any electron-electron
collisions or have only been scattered at small angles. Theoretically, the
small-angle scattering exhibits distinct features that can be traced back to
the reduced dimensionality of the electron system. A number of nonlinear
effects, also related to the two-dimensional character of the system, are
discussed. In the simplest situation, the heating of the electron gas by the
high-energy part of the beam leads to a weakening of the signal of
quasiballistic electrons and to the appearance of thermovoltage. This results
in a nonmonotonic dependence of the detector signal on the intensity of the
injected beam, as observed experimentally.
