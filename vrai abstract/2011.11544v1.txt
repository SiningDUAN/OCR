 We consider weakly ionized plasma where frequent elastic scattering of
electrons on neutrals change the individual acts and the rate of
electron-electron collisions significantly. In this case, the kinetics of
electron thermalization is very different from that in fully ionized plasma.
The colliding electrons diffuse because of fast scattering on neutrals. We
demonstrate how a proper account of this diffusion enables one to estimate the
characteristic time of electron thermalization. We also present a rigorous
derivation of the kinetic equation for electrons by using Bogolyubov method
based on Liouville equations for multi-particle distribution functions.
