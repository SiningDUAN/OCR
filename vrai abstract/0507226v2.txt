 Density-matrix renormalization group is used to study the pairing when both
of electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions are strong in the
Holstein-Hubbard model at half-filling in a region intermediate between the
adiabatic (Migdal's) and antiadiabatic limits. We have found: (i) the pairing
correlation obtained for a one-dimensional system is nearly degenerate with the
CDW correlation in a region where the phonon-induced attraction is comparable
with the electron-electron repulsion, but (ii) pairing becomes dominant when we
destroy the electron-hole symmetry in a trestle lattice. This provides an
instance in which pairing can arise, in a lattice-structure dependent manner,
from coexisting electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions.
