 We discuss the applicability of the Boltzmann equation to the classical
two-dimensional electron gas. We show that in the presence of both the
electron-impurity and electron-electron scattering the Boltzmann equation can
be inapplicable and the correct result for conductivity can be different from
the one obtained from the kinetic equation by a logarithmically large factor.
