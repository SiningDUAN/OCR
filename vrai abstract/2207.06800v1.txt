 Some properties of the electron-electron collision operator in graphene are
analyzed along with the evaluation of collision rate. Monte Carlo simulations
complete the study and highlight the non negligible role of the
electron-electron scattering for an accurate evaluation of the currents and, as
a consequence, of the characteristic curves.
