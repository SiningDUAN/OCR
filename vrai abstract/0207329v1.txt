 We develop a non-perturbative numerical method to study a single electron
tunneling through an Aharonov-Bohm ring in the presence of bound, interacting
electrons. Inelastic processes and spin-flip scattering are properly taken into
account. We show that electron-electron interactions described by the Hubbard
Hamiltonian lead to strong dephasing and we obtain high transmission
probability at Phi=pi even at small interaction strength. Depending on the
many-electron state on the ring, dephasing can occur in elastic or inelastic
channels with or without changing the spin of the scattering electron.
