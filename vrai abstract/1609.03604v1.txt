 We introduce the idea that the electronic band structure of a charge density
wave system may mimic the electronic structure of graphene. In that case a
class of materials quite different from graphene might be opened up to exploit
graphene's remarkable electronic properties. The theory of such materials,
along with superconductivity, is based on the material's dynamical, rather than
its static, properties. The charge density wave system turns out to have a
number of requirements: (1) a specific wave geometry simply related to
graphene; (2) a self-consistency among the electrons that requires the net
Coulomb and phonon-mediated parts of the electron-electron interactions to be
attractive. We develop a model that leads to an analytical expression for the
total energy in terms of the effective electron mass $\mu$, the electron
density $\rho_0$, and the strength $\tilde{\nu}_{K}$ of the net
electron-electron interaction. For constant $\mu>0$ and $\rho_0$, we examine
the limitations set upon $\tilde{\nu}_{K}$ by self-consistency, stability, and
the approximation in the electronic state calculation, and find them to be
mutually compatible. This demonstrates the viability of our model.
