 We consider the possibility of formation of a superconductivity state either
in a semiconductor or in a electron-hole plasma with the degenerate electrons
due to the attractive forces between the electrons as a result of the exchange
effects through the electron-hole sound wave by analogy to the phonon waves in
a solid state. We have determined the view of an interaction potential between
two electrons in a degenerate electron-hole plasma. The potential appears to be
attractive at distances large than the Debye radius and decreases as $1/r^3$.
We discuss the conditions at which the bound electron state - Cooper Pair in a
such field can be formed.
