 Electron dynamics in Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Source is numerically
simulated by using Particle-In-Cell code combined with simulations of the ion
dynamics. Mean electron energies are found to be around 70 keV close to values
that are derived from spectra of X-ray emission out of the source. Electron
life time is defined by losses of low-energy electrons created in ionizing
collisions; the losses are regulated by electron heating rate, which depends on
magnitude of the microwave electric field. Changes in ion confinement with
variations in the microwave electric field and gas flow are simulated.
Influence of electron dynamics on the afterglow and two-frequency heating
effects is discussed.
