 It is shown that measurements of zero-frequency shot-noise can provide
information on electron-electron interaction, because the strong interaction
results in the nonlinear voltage dependence of the shot noise in metallic
wires. This is due to the fact that the Wiedemann-Franz law is no longer valid
in the case of considerable electron-electron interaction. The deviations from
this law increase the noise power and make it dependent strongly on the ratio
of electron-electron and electron-impurity scattering rates.
