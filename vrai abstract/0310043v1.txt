 General theorem describing a relation between diagonal of one-electron
density matrix and a certain class of many-electron ensembles of determinant
states is proved. As a corollary to this theorem a constructive proof of
sufficiency of Coleman's representability conditions is obtained. It is shown
that there exist rigorous schemes for construction of energy of many-electron
system as functionals of one-electron density.
