 Studies of charge-charge (ion-ion, ion-electron, and electron-electron)
coupling properties for ion impurities in an electron gas and for a two
component plasma are carried out on the basis of a regularized electron-ion
potential without short-range Coulomb divergence. This work is motivated in
part by questions arising from recent spectroscopic measurements revealing
discrepancies with present theoretical descriptions. Many of the current
radiative property models for plasmas include only single electron-emitter
collisions and neglect some or all charge-charge interactions. A molecular
dynamics simulation of dipole relaxation is proposed here to allow proper
account of many electron-emitter interactions and all charge-charge couplings.
As illustrations, molecular dynamics simulations are reported for the cases of
a single ion imbedded in an electron plasma and for a two-component
ion-electron plasma. Ion-ion, electron-ion, and electron-electron coupling
effects are discussed for hydrogen-like Balmer alpha lines.
