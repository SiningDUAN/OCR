 When atoms are organized into a crystal, the single-electron energy levels of
individual atoms form energy bands. However, there also exist electron-pair
states in atoms. We found previously that the counterpart of these
electron-pair states of individual atoms may survive in a two-dimensional
square-lattice crystal. When the amplitude of the crystal potential is larger
than a certain value, a metastable electron-pair band arises between the two
lowest single-electron energy bands. In this paper, we demonstrate that the
many-particle exchange-correlation corrections renormalize the energy bands and
may stabilize the electron pairs for certain hole and electron-pair densities
in the two-dimensional crystal. Therefore, depending upon the crystal potential
and free carrier densities, there may exist a new many-particle system
consisting of electron pairs and holes. Furthermore, we calculate the
charge-density excitation spectrum in this new many-particle system.
