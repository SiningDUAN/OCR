 Since the initial proposal in 1990s, the method of electron lenses has been
successfully developed and employed at the high energy particle colliders, like
Tevatron and RHIC. Here we propose a new set of electron multi beam elements
(electron grids, electron lattices, electron grates and other) which employ
many beams in various spatial configurations, with possible time varying
currents. We present major principles of operation and generation of such
systems and briefly discuss a set of possible applications in accelerators.
