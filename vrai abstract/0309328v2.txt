 Using a symmetry-based atomic scale theory of lattice distortions, we
demonstrate that elastic textures, such as twin and antiphase boundaries, can
generate intricate electronic inhomogeneities in materials with strong
electron-lattice coupling, as observed in perovskite manganites and other
functional materials.
