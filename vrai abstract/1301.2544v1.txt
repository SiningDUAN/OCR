 The total energy of a quasi-one-dimensional electron system is calculated
using density functional theory. It is shown that spontaneous ferromagnetic
state in quantum wire occurs at low one-dimensional electron density. The
critical electron density below which electrons are in spin-polarized state is
estimated analytically.
