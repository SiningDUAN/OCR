 We study a two dimensional electron system in a parabolic confining potential
and constant magnetic field for the case of harmonic electron-electron
interaction. We present analytic results for the electrochemical potential
versus magnetic field and discuss the effects of correlation in connection with
the addition energy of a Quantum Dot with few electrons.
