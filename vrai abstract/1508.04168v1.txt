 The results of experimental investigations of electron ejection from
gas-discharge nonneutral electron plasma at the formation and radial
oscillations of vortex structure have been presented. The electrons are
injected from the vortex structure and the adjacent region of electron sheath
in the form of pulses the duration and periodicity of which are determined by
the processes of evolution and dynamics of this structure. The possible
mechanisms of pulse ejection of electrons are considered. The influence of
electron ejection on other processes in discharge electron sheath is analyzed.
