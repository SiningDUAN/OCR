 We present a quantum calculation of the electron degeneracy for electron
sources. We explore quantum interference of electrons in the temporal and
spatial domain and demonstrate how it can be utilized to characterize a pulsed
electron source. We estimate effects of Coulomb repulsion on two-electron
interference and show that currently available nano tip pulsed electron sources
operate in the regime where the quantum nature of electrons can be made
dominant.
