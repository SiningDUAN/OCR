 We present a universal expression for the electronic friction as felt by a
set of classical nuclear degrees of freedom (DoF's) coupled to a manifold of
quantum electronic DoF's; no assumptions are made regarding the nature of the
electronic Hamiltonian and electron-electron repulsions are allowed. Our
derivation is based on a quantum-classical Liouville equation (QCLE) for the
coupled electronic-nuclear motion, followed by an adiabatic approximation
whereby electronic transitions are assumed to equilibrate faster than nuclear
movement. The resulting form of friction is completely general, but does reduce
to previously published expressions for the quadratic Hamiltonian (i.e.
Hamiltonians without electronic correlation). At equilibrium, the second
fluctuation-dissipation theorem is satisfied and the frictional matrix is
symmetric. To demonstrate the importance of electron-electron correlation, we
study electronic friction within the Anderson-Holstein model, where a proper
treatment of electron-electron interactions shows signatures of a Kondo
resonance and a mean-field treatment is completely inadequate.
