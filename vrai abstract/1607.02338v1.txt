 The effect of the resonance of electron scattering energy difference and
phonon energy on the electron-phonon-electron interaction (EPEI) is studied.
Results show that the resonance of electron transition energy and phonon energy
can enhance EPEI by a magnitude of 1 to 2. Moreover, the anisotropic S-wave
electron or dx2-y2 electron can enhance resonance EPEI, and the self-energy
correction of the electron will weaken resonance EPEI. Particularly, the
asymmetrical spin-flip scattering process in k space can reduce the effect of
electronic self-energy to enhance resonance EPEI
