 We discuss a possibility to observe fast secondary electrons
($\delta-$electrons) during nuclear $\beta^{-}$-decay in few-electron atoms and
ions. Formulas for the corresponding probabilities and explicit expression for
the energy spectrum of $\delta-$electrons are derived in the closed analytical
forms.
