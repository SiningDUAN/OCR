 A free electron can temporarily gain a very significant amount of energy if
it is overrun by an intense electromagnetic wave. In principle, this process
would permit large enhancements in the center-of-mass energy of
electron-electron, electron-positron and electron-photon interactions if these
take place in the presence of an intense laser beam. Practical considerations
severely limit the utility of this concept for contemporary lasers incident on
relativistic electrons. A more accessible laboratory phenomenon is
electron-positron production via an intense laser beam incident on a gas.
Intense electromagnetic pulses of astrophysical origin can lead to very
energetic photons via bremsstrahlung of temporarily accelerated electrons.
