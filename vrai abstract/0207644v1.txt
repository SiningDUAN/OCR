 The ground-state behavior of the symmetric electron-electron and
electron-hole bilayers is studied by including dynamic correlation effects
within the quantum version of Singwi, Tosi, Land, and Sjolander (qSTLS) theory.
The static pair-correlation functions, the local-field correction factors, and
the ground-state energy are calculated over a wide range of carrier density and
layer spacing. The possibility of a phase transition into a density-modulated
ground state is also investigated. Results for both the electron-electron and
electron-hole bilayers are compared with those of recent diffusion Monte Carlo
(DMC) simulation studies. We find that the qSTLS results differ markedly from
those of the conventional STLS approach and compare in the overall more
favorably with the DMC predictions. An important result is that the qSTLS
theory signals a phase transition from the liquid to the coupled Wigner crystal
ground state, in both the electron-electron and electron-hole bilayers, below a
critical density and in the close proximity of layers (d <~ r_sa_0^*), in
qualitative agreement with the findings of the DMC simulations.
