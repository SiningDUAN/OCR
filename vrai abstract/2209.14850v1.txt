 The interaction of light and swift electrons has enabled phase-coherent
manipulation and acceleration of electron wavepackets. Here we investigate this
interaction in a new regime where low-energy electrons (~20-200 eV) interact
with a phase-matched light field. Our analytical and numerical study shows that
slow electrons are subject to strong confinement in the energy domain due to
the non-vanishing curvature of the electron dispersion. The spectral trap is
tunable and an appropriate choice of light field parameters can reduce the
interaction dynamics to only two energy states. The capacity to trap electrons
expands the scope of electron beam physics, free-electron quantum optics and
quantum simulators.
