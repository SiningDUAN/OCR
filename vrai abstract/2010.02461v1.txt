 Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is pivotal for various fundamental spin-dependent
phenomena in solids and their technological applications. In semiconductors,
these phenomena have been so far studied in relatively weak electron-electron
interaction regimes, where the single electron picture holds. However, SOC can
profoundly compete against Coulomb interaction, which could lead to the
emergence of unconventional electronic phases. Since SOC depends on the
electric field in the crystal including contributions of itinerant electrons,
electron-electron interactions can modify this coupling. Here we demonstrate
the emergence of SOC effect in a high-mobility two-dimensional electron system
in a simple band structure MgZnO/ZnO semiconductor. This electron system
features also strong electron-electron interaction effects. By changing the
carrier density with Mg-content, we tune the SOC strength and achieve its
interplay with electron-electron interaction. These systems pave a way to
emergent spintronic phenomena in strong electron correlation regime and to the
formation of novel quasiparticles with the electron spin strongly coupled to
the density.
