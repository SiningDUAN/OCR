 An electron mobility enhancement is the very important phenomenon of an
electron in the electronic device, where the high electronic device performance
has the good electron mobility, which is obtained by the overall electron drift
velocity in the electronic material driven potential difference. The increasing
in electron mobility by the injected high group velocity pulse is proposed in
this article. By using light pulse input into the nonlinear microring
resonator, light pulse group velocity can be tuned and increased, from which
the required output group velocity can be obtained, which can be used to drive
electron within the plasmonic waveguide, where eventually, the relative
electron mobility can be obtained, the increasing in the electron mobility
after adding up by the driven optical fields can be connected to the external
electronic devices and circuits, which can be useful for many applications.
