 In recent work, we discussed the difference between electrons and holes in
energy band in solids from a many-particle point of view, originating in the
electron-electron interaction, and argued that it has fundamental consequences
for superconductivity. Here we discuss the fact that there is also a
fundamental difference between electrons and holes already at the single
particle level, arising from the electron-ion interaction. The difference
between electrons and holes due to this effect parallels the difference due to
electron-electron interactions: {\it holes are more dressed than electrons}. We
propose that superconductivity originates in 'undressing' of carriers from
$both$ electron-electron and electron-ion interactions, and that both aspects
of undressing have observable consequences.
