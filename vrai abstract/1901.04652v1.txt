 Ultrafast electron dynamics of solids after an absorption of femtosecond
laser pulse is governed by electron-electron, electron-phonon, phonon-electron,
and phonon-phonon collisions. It is of importance to construct a framework for
interpreting experimental observations correctly. In this paper we review
recent developments of modeling the relaxation dynamics of solids. We discuss
the ultrafast relaxation in respect to the effective temperature dynamics and
the excess energy dynamics.
