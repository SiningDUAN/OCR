 We present a microscopic theory of the optical properties of self-assembled
quantum dots doped with a single magnetic manganese (Mn) impurity and
containing a controlled number of electrons. The single-particle electron and
heavy-hole electronic shells are described by two-dimensional harmonic
oscillators. The electron-electron, electron-hole Coulomb as well as the
short-range electron spin-Mn spin and hole spin-Mn spin contact exchange
interactions are included. The electronic states of the photo-excited
electron-hole-Mn complex and of the final electron-Mn complex are expanded in a
finite number of configurations and the full interacting Hamiltonian is
diagonalized numerically. The emission spectrum is predicted as a function of
photon energy for a given number of electrons and different number of confined
electronic quantum dot shells. We show how emission spectra allow to identify
the number of electronic shells, the number of electrons populating these
shells and, most importantly, their spin. We show that electrons not
interacting directly with the spin of Mn ion do so via electron-electron
interactions. This indirect interaction is a strong effect even when Mn
impurity is away from the quantum dot center.
