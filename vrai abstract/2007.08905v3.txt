 The quadratic low-temperature dependence of resistance in ordinary metals is
determined by the momentum relaxation due to electron-electron scattering in
the presence Umklapp processes and scattering on impurities. In metals without
inversion center spin-orbit interaction of electrons with crystal lattice lifts
spin degeneracy of electron states and splits each band on two bands. The
temperature dependence of electron-electron collisions scattering rate is found
using the matrix kinetic equation including the electron-impurity and
electron-electron intra and inter band scattering. It is shown that in clean
enough case when the energy of band splitting exceeds the electron-impurity
scattering rate but at the same time it is much smaller than the Fermi energy
the square low-temperature dependence of resistivity is still valid.
