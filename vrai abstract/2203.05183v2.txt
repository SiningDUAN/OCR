 Rejuvenation of hydrodynamic transport in solids provides a new window to
study collective motion of electrons, where electrons behave like a viscous
fluid akin to classical liquids. Experimental observations of such exotic
states have not been realized until recent years, and an on-going quest is to
amplify the hydrodynamic effect in electron fluids. Here we investigate the
hydrodynamic properties of Dirac electron fluid in graphene from a microscopic
viewpoint, and elucidate a novel way to enhance electron hydrodynamics. In
particular, we present strong evidence that the shear viscosity of Dirac
electrons can be enhanced by frequent electron-hole collisions, through three
distinct aspects: promoting electrons and holes around the Dirac point by
disorder, creating electron-hole shared zeroth Landau level by external
magnetic field, and inducing electron-hole excitations by dynamic deformation.
We also study Hall viscosity, which is closely related to the geometric
topology and exhibits quantum behavior analogous to Hall conductivity.
Therefore, our work demonstrates the exotic landscape of hydrodynamic
electronics in graphene, and presents experimentally relevant responses to
quantify the effects of electronic viscosity.
