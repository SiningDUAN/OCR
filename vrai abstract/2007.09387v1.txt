 The interplay between electron-electron interaction and electron-phonon
coupling has been one of the key issues in graphene as it can provide
information on the origin of enhanced electron-phonon coupling in graphene by
foreign atoms. In ytterbium-decorated graphene on SiC substrate,
electron-phonon coupling exhibits strong enhancement compared to that of
as-grown graphene. Based on angle-resolved photoemission study, the presence of
ytterbium is also found to result in the decrease of Fermi velocity, revealing
the enhancement of electron-electron interaction within the Fermi liquid
theory. Our finding on the concomitant enhancement of electron-electron
interaction and electron-phonon coupling suggests a possibility of the
interplay between the two representative many-body interactions in graphene
decorated with foreign atoms.
