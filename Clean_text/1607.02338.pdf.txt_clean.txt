.resonant electron—phonon-electron interaction jiang-tao liu? department of physics, nanchang university, nanchang 330031, china nanoscale science and technology laboratory, institute for advanced study, nanchang university, nanchang 330031, china abstract: the effect of the resonance of electron scattering energy difference and phonon energy on the electron—phonon-electron interaction (epei) is studied. results show that the resonance of electron transition energy and phonon energy can enhance epei by a magnitude of | to 2. moreover, the anisotropic s-wave electron or dap electron can enhance resonance epei, and the self-energy correction of the electron will weaken resonance epei. particularly, the asymmetrical spin-flip scattering process in k space can reduce the effect of electronic self-energy to enhance resonance epei. 1. introduction electron—phonon-electron interaction (epei) has always been an important research issue in the field of condensed matter physics [1-12]. mutual attraction between electrons can be expressed by regarding lattice vibration as the medium. mutually attractive epei that leads to a cooper pair explains the traditional superconducting phenomenon[1-6]. however, traditional epei is weaker, and the binding energy of the cooper pair is lower. meanwhile, a traditional superconductor has lower transition temperature
