..acc-ph] 24 mar 2000 1cs /0003073v1 [physi 1ccs iv:phys arxx temporary acceleration of electrons while inside an intense electromagnetic pulse kirk t. mcdonald joseph henry laboratories, princeton university, princeton, nj 08544 konstantine shmakov globalstar, inc., san jose, ca 95461 (nov. 20, 1997) a free electron can temporarily gain a very significant amount of energy if it is overrun by an intense electromag- netic wave. in principle, this process would permit large en- hancements in the center-of-mass energy of electron-electron, electron-positron and electron-photon interactions if these take place in the presence of an intense laser beam. prac- tical considerations severely limit the utility of this concept for contemporary lasers incident on relativistic electrons. a more accessible laboratory phenomenon is electron-positron production via an intense laser beam incident on a gas. in- tense electromagnetic pulses of astrophysical origin can lead to very energetic photons via bremsstrahlung of temporarily accelerated electrons. pacs numbers: 03
