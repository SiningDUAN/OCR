.arxiv:1601.02855v1 [nucl-th] 6 jan 2016: on the emission of the fast d—electrons during nuclear (6 -decay in few-electron atoms alexei m. rieladd department of applied mathematics university of western ontario, london, ontario n6h 5b7, canada (dated: june 19, 2018) abstract we discuss a possibility to observe fast secondary electrons (6—electrons) during nuclear 87 - decay in few-electron atoms/ions. formulas for the corresponding probabilities and velocity spec- trum of the d—electrons are derived in the closed analytical forms. pacs number(s): 23.40.-s, 12.20.ds and 14.60
