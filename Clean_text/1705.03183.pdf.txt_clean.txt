.arxiv:1705.03183v3 [hep-ph] 23 apr 2018 wigner distributions for an electron narinder kumar department of physics, indian institute of technology kanpur, kanpur-208016, india chandan mondal institute for modern physics, chinese academy of sciences, lanzhou-730000, china abstract we study the wigner distributions for a physical electron, which reveal the multidimensional images of the electron. the physical electron is considered as a composite system of a bare electron and photon. the wigner distributions for unpolarized, longitudinally polarized and transversely polarized electron are presented in transverse momentum plane as well as in impact-parameter plane. the spin-spin correlations between the bare electron and the physical electron are discussed. we also evaluate all the leading twist generalized transverse momentum distributions (gtmds) for electron. keywords: wigner distribution, qed model, gtmds, light-front wavefunctions 1. introduction what is the shape of an electron? most probably our answer is spherical but electron is a point particle having no underlying substructure. in quantum electrodynamics (qed electron is considered as an elementary field. when we talk about the electron “structure” , what we are actually doing is probing the fluctuations in the quantum theory
