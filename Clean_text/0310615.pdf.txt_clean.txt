.cond-mat/0310615v1 [cond-mat.str-el] 27 oct 2003 1v arx exact electron-pairing ground states of tight-binding models with local attractive interactions akinori tanaka department of applied quantum physics, kyushu university, fukuoka 812-8581, japan (dated: september 30, 2018) we present a class of exactly solvable models of correlated electrons. the models are defined in any dimension d and consist of electron-hopping terms and local attractive interactions between electrons. for each even number of electrons less than or equal to 1/(d+1)-filling, we find the exact ground state in which all electrons form pairs of a certain type, and thus the models exhibit an electron-pair condensation. pacs numbers: 71.10.fd, 74.20.-z the origin of high-temperature superconductivity has attracted much interest and is still controversial. on the other hand, the properties of usual (low-temperature) superconductors are well explained by the celebrated bardeen-cooper-schrieffer (bcs) theory fi
