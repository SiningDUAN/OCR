.some aspects of electron dynamics in electron cyclotron resonance ion sources v. mironov, s. bogomolov, a. bondarchenko, a. efremov, and v. loginov joint institute for nuclear research, flerov laboratory of nuclear reactions, dubna, moscow reg. 141980, russia abstract electron dynamics in electron cyclotron resonance ion source is numerically simulated by using particle-in-cell code combined with simulations of the ion dynamics. mean electron energies are found to be around 70 kev close to values that are derived from spectra of x-ray emission out of the source. electron life time is defined by losses of low-energy electrons created in ionizing collisions; the losses are regulated by electron heating rate, which depends on magnitude of the microwave electric field. changes in ion confinement with variations in the microwave electric field and gas flow are simulated
