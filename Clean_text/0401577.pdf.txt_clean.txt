.electron-electron scattering effects on the full counting statistics of mesoscopic conductors s. pilgram département de physique théorique, université de genéve, ch-1211 genéve 4, switzerland (dated: october 29, 2018) in the hot electron regime, electron-electron scattering strongly modifies not only the shot noise but also the full counting statistics. we employ a method based on a stochastic path integral to calculate the counting statistics of two systems in which noise in the hot electron regime has been experimentally measured. we give an analytical expression for the counting statistics of a chaotic cavity and find that heating due to electron-electron scattering renders the distribution of transmitted charge symmetric in the shot noise limit. we also discuss the frequency dispersion of the third order correlation function and present numerical calculations for the statistics of diffusive wires in the hot electron regime. pacs numbers: 73.23.-b, 05.40.-a, 72
