.2101.10508v1 [cond-mat.quant-gas] 26 jan 2021 arxiv insights into the electron-electron interaction from quantum monte carlo calculations and kun chen! a ‘center for computational quantum physics, flatiron institute, 162 fifth avenue, new york, ny 10010 (dated: january 27, 2021) the effective electron-electron interaction in the electron gas depends on both the density and spin local field factors. variational diagrammatic quantum monte carlo calculations of the spin local field factor are reported and used to quantitatively present the full spin-dependent, electron- electron interaction. together with the charge local field factor from previous diffusion quantum monte carlo calculations, we obtain the complete form of the effective electron-electron interaction in the uniform three-dimensional electron gas. very simple quadratic formulas are presented for the local fiel metallic densities. factors that quantitatively produce all of the response functions of the electron gas at exchange and correlation become increasingly important at low densities. at the compressibility divergence at rs = 5.25, both the direct (screened coulomb) term and the charge-dependent exchange term in the electron-electron interaction at q=0 are separately divergent. however, due to large cancellations, their difference is finite, well behaved, and much smaller than either term separately
