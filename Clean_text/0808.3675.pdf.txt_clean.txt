.arxiv:0808.3675v2 [cond-mat.str-el] 8 jul 2009: how do we interrogate the electrons without roughing them up? andrew das arulsamy and marco fronzi school of physics, the university of sydney, sydney, new south wales 2006, australia electrons are indistinguishable, but the energy of each electron is different in different materials and if we can exploit this energy, then we can systematically study the changes of electronic properties in non free-electron metals. one of the fundamental requirements from the electronic characterizations of materials is to understand what parameters effectively control the flow of electrons. but we do not have the authority to demand nor persuade the nature to reveal its secret parameters. adding to that, all electrons are the same, indistinguishable, we cannot distinguish one from another, be it in a metal or a wood. however, the en- ergy that each or a group of electrons possess is different in different materials due to different types of atoms in a given material. this is also true for electrons in atoms due to different magnitudes of electron-nucleus coulomb force. in view of this, what we are proposing here is a methodology that, instead of roughing-up the electrons with various experimental techniques, we can interrogate their parent atoms to reveal information about their electronic energies. in other words, the atomic ionization en- ergy or the atomic energy-level difference (see figure[i]) can be used to theoretically predict the systematic changes to the conductivity, carrier density, electron-phonon interaction, heat capacity and spin-orbit coupling strength, with respect to differ- ent dopant in a given non free-electron compound
