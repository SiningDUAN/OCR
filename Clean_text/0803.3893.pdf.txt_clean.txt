.arxiv:0803.3893v1 [astro-ph] 27 mar 2008 shear viscosity of degenerate electron matter p. s. shternin ioffe physical technical institute, politekhnicheskaya 26, 194021 saint-petersburg, russia e-mail: pshternin@gmail.com abstract. we calculate the partial electron shear viscosity jee limited by electron- electron collisions in a strongly degenerate electron gas taking into account the landau damping of transverse plasmons. the landau damping strongly suppresses mee in the domain of ultrarelativistic degenerate electrons and modifies its temperature behavior. the efficiency of the electron shear viscosity in the cores of white dwarfs and envelopes of neutron stars is analyzed. pacs numbers: 52.25
