.electron multi-beams (“electron grids”, “electron lattices” and “electron grates”): new elements for accelerators vladimir shiltsev fermi national accelerator laboratory, po box 500, batavia, il 60510, usa abstract since the initial proposal in 1990’s, the method of electron lenses has been successfully developed and employed at the high energy particle colliders, like tevatron and rhic. here we propose a new set of electron multi-beam elements — electron grids, electron lattices, electron grates and other — which employ many beams in various spatial configurations, with possible time-varying currents. we present major principles of operation and generation of such systems and briefly discuss a set of possible applications in accelerators. pacs numbers: 29.25.bx, 29.27.eg, 29.20.-c
