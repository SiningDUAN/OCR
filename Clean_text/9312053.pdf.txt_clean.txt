.‘arxiv:cond-mat/9312053v1 14 dec 1993: submitted to physical review letters accounting for both electron—lattice and electron—electron coupling in conjugated polymers: minimum total energy calculations on the hubbard—peierls hamiltonian. giuseppe rossi ford research laboratory, ford motor company, p.o. box 2053, mail drop 3198, dearborn, mi 48121-2053. absract. minimum total energy calculations, which account for both electron—lattice and electron— electron interactions in conjugated polymers are performed for chains with up to eight carbon atoms. these calculations are motivated in part by recent experimental results on the spectroscopy of polyenes and con- jugated polymers and shed light on the longstanding question of the relative importance of electron—lattice vs. electron-electron interactions in determining the properties of these systems. pacs numbers: 31.20
