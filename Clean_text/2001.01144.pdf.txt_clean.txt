'research laboratory of electronics, massachusetts institute of technology, cambridge, massachusetts 02139, united states abstract electron beams can acquire designed phase modulations by passing through nanostructured material phase plates. these phase modulations enable electron wavefront shaping and benefit electron microscopy, spectroscopy, lithography, and interferometry. however, in the fabrication of electron phase plates, the typically used focused-ion-beam-milling method limits the fabrication throughput and hence the active area of the phase plates. here, we fabricated large-area electron phase plates with electron-beam lithography and reactive-ion-etching. the phase plates are characterized by electron diffraction in transmission electron microscopes with various electron energies, as well as diffractive imaging in a scanning electron microscope. we found the phase plates could produce a null in the center of the bright-field based on coherent interference of diffractive beams. our work adds capabilities to the fabrication of electron phase plates
