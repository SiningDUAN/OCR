.the electric field of an electron in a electron-hole plasma with degenerate electrons s, bp sadykova!, a. a. rukhadze ' forschungszentrum julich, jiilich supercomputing center, jiilich, germany 2 prokhorov general physics institute, russian academy of sciences, moscow, russia abstract we consider the possibility of formation of a superconductivity state either in a semiconductor or in a electron-hole plasma with the degenerate electrons due to the attractive forces between the electrons as a result of the exchange effects through the electron-hole sound wave by analogy to the phonon waves in a solid state. we have determined the view of an interaction potential between two electrons in a degenerate electron-hole plasma. the potential appears to be attractive at distances large than the debye radius and decreases as 1/r?. we discuss the conditions at which the bound electron state - cooper pair in a such field can be formed. introduction here we would like to consider the conditions for existence of the electron-hole sound waves in a semiconductor at cryogenic temperatures when electrons (light and of a negative charge) are degenerate and one of the major unsolved problems of the superconductivity theory is determination of the static potential of a point electron. obviously, the sign of the electron potential in a superconductive medium must be opposite to that in a vacuum. this follows from the bardeen-cooper-schrieffer theory, since the cooper electron pair can form only when the potential appears to be attractive for both electrons. below, we will show that in a electron-hole plasma of a semiconductor when the electrons are degenerate and holes are not degenerate, i
