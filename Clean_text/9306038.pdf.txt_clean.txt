.‘ar xiv:cond-mat/9306038vl 17 jun 1993: phys. rev. lett., 7 june 1993 electron—electron scattering in quantum wires and it’s possible suppression due to spin effects gerhard fasol and hiroyuki sakaki research center for advanced science and technology (rcast), university of tokyo, 4-6-1 komaba, meguro-ku, tokyo 153, japan a microscopic picture of electron-electron pair scattering in single mode quantum wires is introduced which includes electron spin. a new source of ‘excess’ noise for hot carriers is presented. we show that zero magnetic field ‘spin’ splitting in quantum wires can lead to a dramatic ‘spin’-subband dependence of electron-electron scat- tering, including the possibility of strong suppression. as a consequence extremely long electron coherence lengths and new spin-related phenomena are predicted. since electron bands in iii-v semiconductor quantum wires are in general spin-split in zero applied magnetic field, these new transport effects are of general importance. pacs numbers: 73.40
