.spin dynamics of electrons in the first excited subband of a high-mobility low-density 2d electron system haihui luo, xuan qian, xuezhong ruan, yang ui sklsm, institute of semiconductors, chinese academy of sciences, beijing 100083, people’s republic of china v. umansky braun center for submicron research, department of condensed matter physics, weizmann institute of science, rehovot 76100, israel *author to whom correspondence should be addressed, jiyang@red.semi.ac.cn we report on time-resolved kerr rotation measurements of spin coherence of electrons in the first excited subband of a high-mobility low-density two-dimensional electron system in a gaas/alp3sgao.osas heterostructure. while the transverse spin lifetime (7; ) of electrons decreases monotonically with increasing magnetic field, it has a non-monotonic dependence on the temperature, with a peak value of 596 ps at 36 k, indicating the effect of inter-subband electron-electron scattering on the electron spin relaxation. the spin lifetime may be long enough for potential device application with electrons in excited subbands. pacs numbers: 72.25
