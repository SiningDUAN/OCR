..plasm-ph] 3 feb 2020 ics 1910.13505v2 [phys arxiv correlations between conduction electrons in dense plasmas nathaniel r. shaffef] and charles e. starrett los alamos national laboratory (dated: february 4, 2020) most treatments of electron-electron correlations in dense plasmas either ignore them entirely (random phase approximation) or neglect the role of ions (jellium approximation). in this work, we go beyond both these approximations to derive a new formula for the electron-electron static structure factor which properly accounts for the contributions of both ionic structure and quantum- mechanical dynamic response in the electrons. the result can be viewed as a natural extension of the quantum ornstein-zernike theory of ionic and electronic correlations, and it is suitable for dense plasmas in which the ions are classical and the conduction electrons are quantum-mechanical. the corresponding electron-electron pair distribution functions are compared with the results of path integral monte carlo simulations, showing good agreement whenever no strong electron resonance states are present. we construct approximate potentials of mean force which describe the effective screened interaction between electrons. significant deviations from debye-hiickel screening are present at temperatures and densities relevant to high energy density experiments involving warm and hot dense plasmas
