.spin polarization of electrons in quantum wires a.a. vasilchenko kuban state technological university, krasnodar, russia the total energy of a quasi-one-dimensional electron system is calculated using density functional theory. it is shown that spontaneous ferromagnetic state in quantum wire occurs at low one-dimensional electron density. the critical electron density below which electrons are in spin-polarized state is estimated analytically. the low-dimensional electron systems in semiconductors are one of the most actual and intensively developing areas in condensed matter physics for the last decades. the phenomena as integer and fractional quantum hall effects, wigner crystallization, metal-dielectric transition, conductivity quantization, persistent current oscillations, coulomb blockade have been discovered in the low-dimension electron systems. the quantum wires (qw) properties have been studied less than properties of quantum wells and quantum dots. the phenomena like wigner crystallization, spontaneous electron polarization in the zero magnetic field, "0.7 anomaly" of conductivity may take place in qw
