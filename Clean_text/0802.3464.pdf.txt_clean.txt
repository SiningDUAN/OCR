.an electronic radiation of blackbody: cosmic electron background jian-miin liu (x er)* department of physics, nanjing university nanjing, the people’s republic of china *on leave. e-mail: liu@phys.uri.edu abstract the universe owns the electronic radiation of blackbody at temperature 2.725 k, which we call the cosmic electron background. we calculate its radiation spectrum. the energy distribution of number density of electrons in the cosmic electron background becomes zero as energy goes to both zero and infinity. it has one maximum peak near the energy level of 107° v. the spectrum of cosmic microwave background was firstly discovered by penzias and wilson in 1972 [1]. later, it was confirmed by different research groups, especially those groups using the “cosmic background explorer” (cobe) satellite system launched in november of 1989, to be a one of radiation of nearly perfect blackbody at temperature t,=2
