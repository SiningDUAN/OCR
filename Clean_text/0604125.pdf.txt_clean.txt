.electron-phonon scattering in semiconductor structures with one-dimensional electron gas d.v. pozdnyakov', v.o. galenchik radiophysics and electronics department, belarus state university, nezavisimosty av. 4, 220050 minsk, belarus abstract in this study a method for calculation of the electron-phonon scattering rate in semiconductor structures with one-dimensional electron gas is developed. the energy uncertainty of electrons is taken into account. keywords: energy uncertainty; electron-phonon scattering at present both theoretical and experimental investigations of semiconductor structures with one-dimensional (1d) electron gas are of great interest [1—3]. because of the application of these structures in electronics, understanding of their electrophysical properties becomes of prime im- portance. the monte carlo simulation is one of the most promising approaches in the study of electron transport in the systems with 1d electron gas [4, 5]
