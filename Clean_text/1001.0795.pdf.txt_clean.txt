.on unconventional electron pairing in a periodic potential valentin voroshilov, physics department, boston university, boston, ma, 02215, usa, valbu@bu.edu on the assumption that two electrons with the same group velocity effectively attract each other a simple model hamiltonian is proposed to question the existence of unconventional electron pairs formed by electrons in a strong periodic potential. 71.10.li despite intensive experimental and theoretical research the mechanism responsible for high temperature superconductivity’ is yet not clear. the goal of this letter is to offer some speculations on the matter as a step toward the future deeper theoretical analysis. among different theoretical approaches there is a view that formation of electron pairs is a natural property of interacting electrons immersed in a strong periodic potential”. in particular, as one of the possibilities a hole-electron paring mechanism is suggested, where an electron is paired with a hole traveling in space in opposite direction’. as a possible extension of that hole-electron paring mechanism we assume that electron pairs are formed by electrons traveling with the same group velocity (at this point we do not impose limits on the energy of interacting electrons). based on the assumption above, we write a model hamiltonian in the following form (eq
