.hamiltonian of a many-electron system with single-electron and electron-pair states in a two-dimensional periodic potential g.-q. hai! and f. m. peeters? l instituto de fisica de sao carlos, universidade de séo paulo, 13560-970, séo carlos, sp, brazil and ? departement fysica, universiteit antwerpen, groenenborgerlaan 171, 2020 antwerpen, belgium based on the metastable clectron-pair energy band in a two-dimensional (2d) periodic potential obtained previously by hai and castelano [j. phys.: condens. matter 26, 115502 (2014)], we present in this work a hamiltonian of many electrons consisting of single electrons and electron pairs in the 2d system. the electron-pair states are metastable of energies higher than those of the single- electron states at low electron density. we assume two different scenarios for the single-electron band
