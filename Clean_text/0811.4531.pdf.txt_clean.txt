.0811.4531v1 [cond-mat.str-el] 27 nov 2008 1v arxx interpolative approach for electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions: from the kondo to the polaronic regime a. martin-rodero, a. levy yeyati, f flores and r. c. monreal departamento de fisica teérica de la materia condensada c-v, universidad auténoma de madrid, e-28049 madrid, spain we present a theoretical approach to determine the electronic properties of nanoscale systems ex- hibiting strong electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions and coupled to metallic electrodes. this approach is based on an interpolative ansatz for the electronic self-energy which becomes exact both in the limit of weak and strong coupling to the electrodes. the method provides a generalization of previous interpolative schemes which have been applied to the purely electronic case extensively. as a test case we consider the single level anderson-holstein model
