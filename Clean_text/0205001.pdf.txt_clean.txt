.arxiv:cond-mat/0205001v1 [cond-mat.str-el] 30 apr 2002 electron-electron interactions in a weakly screened two-dimensional electron system i. karakurt and a.j. dahm department of physics, case western reserve university, cleveland, oh 44106-7079, usa (october 27, 2018) we probe the strength of electron-electron interactions using magnetoconductivity measurements of two-dimensional non-degenerate electrons on liquid helium at 1.22 k. our data extend to electron densities that are two orders of magnitude smaller than previously reported. we span both the independent-electron regime where the data are qualitatively described by the self-consistent born approximation (scba), and the strongly-interacting electron regime. at finite fields we observe a crossover from scba to drude theory as a function of electron density. pacs numbers: 73
